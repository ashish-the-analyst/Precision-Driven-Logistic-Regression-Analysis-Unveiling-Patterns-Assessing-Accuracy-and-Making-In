# Logistic-Regression-Project
Using Logistic Regression model from the 89 speciments to predict the group membership of remaining 199 specimens


1. Format the data contained in the excel spreadsheet for use in R.

2. Perform an exploratory data analysis.

3.	Explain your GLM and assess the quality of the fit with the classified observations.   
  -	Use Cross Validation to predict the accuracy of your model.

4.	Provide a one-page write-up (excluding graphs, tables and figures) explaining your analysis of the dataset and your recommendations on the usefulness of your predictions. 

5.	Provide predictions for the unclassified observations. 		
6.	As a secondary component provide annotated code that replicates your analysis
